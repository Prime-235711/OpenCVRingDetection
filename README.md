You must first have python 3.8 installed that can be obtained from https://www.python.org/ or the Microsoft store.

To use the openCV ring detection you must have the requirements in requirements.txt satisfied. 
To do so navigate to the folder containing requirements.txt and run the command **pip install -r requirements.txt**

After you have Python installed and the requirements filled open python IDLE and open RingDetectionOpenCV.py

You can now run the program.
